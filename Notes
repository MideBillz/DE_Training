 #type' function tells you the class of the variable e.g - int, str.. etc.
# x = 7
# print('x is {}'.format(x))
# print(type(x))

#When dealing with money, it is important to import the decimal library. type 'None' has class 'NoneType' and evaluates to false as a bool
#Literals - Data that is given in a variable or constant( there are 4 types: String,Numeric,Boolean,Special)

#PS:
- List comprehension
- Dictionary comprehension
- Tuple comprehension
- Learn when to use tuples, list and what it means to say Dictionary is hash-data

#Pandas
Open source library that provides data structures(Series and Dataframes) to help manage large data-sets
Dataframes - These are mutable datatypes present in the Pandas Library
e.g
import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv("mydata.csv")(Here is how a CSV file can be read using pandas)
  df.head('5') ('5 is the int argument, you can enter other numbers to denote the amount of rows you want to show')

Series-One dimensional pandas data structure that supports data of almost any type
e.g
import pandas as pd
data = ['1',2,"three", 4.0]

series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)
print(type(series))

Note: Pandas and Numpy are --

#Pandas groupby() function
e.g
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame()

#Create dataframe from a list
df = pd.DataFrame()
cars = ["Mercedes", "Hyundai", "Toyota", "Ferrari","Ford"]
bikes = ["Honda", "TVS", "Kawasaki", "BMW","Bajaj"]

df["cars"] = cars
df["bikes"] = bikes

print(df)

#Create dataframe from a dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame()
cars = ["Mercedes", "Hyundai", "Toyota", "Ferrari","Ford"]
bikes = ["Honda", "TVS", "Kawasaki", "BMW","Bajaj"]

d = {"cars":cars, "bikes":bikes}
df = pd.DataFrame(d)

print(df)

#Combine DataFrames using join() function (The join() function stacks horizontally)
#Best method for vertical staccking is concatenating
#How to merge DataFrames in pandas
#How to drop all rows with NaN
-use the dropna() function
#Access the first five and last five entries of a dataframe
- Use .head(5) function and the .tail(5) function

#Access data from a DataFrame using a value as index
df = pd.DataFrame()
cars = ["Mercedes", "Hyundai", "Toyota", "Ferrari","Ford"]
bikes = ["Honda", "TVS", "Kawasaki", "BMW","Bajaj"]

d = {"cars":cars, "bikes":bikes}
df = pd.DataFrame(d)

a = [10,20,30,40,50]
df.index = a #This assigns the numbers in the array "a" as index to the values in the lists 'cars' and 'bikes'

df.loc[10]

#Add single line and multi-line comments
-Single line uses a hashtag (#)
-multi-line comment is used with 3 triple quotes (""") e.g:
 """
 This
 is
 a
 multi-line
 comment
 """

#Most memory efficient way to add elements to a tuple (Trick question)
 -Tuples are immutable datatypes.
 -You cannot add elements to an existing tuple. A new one must be created if the values are to be changed

#A dictionary
-Dictionary uses curly brackets with keys and values
-Dictionary is a collection of items in no particular order e.g - d = {"a":1, "b":2 }
-They are optimized to retrieve value for known keys

#Measures of central tendency
- This refers to mean, median,standard deviation etc.. (mean(),median(),std())
import numpy as np

n1 = np.array([1,5,5,3,100,4,48])

print(np.mean(n1))
print(np.median(n1))
print(np.std(n1))

#use of a classifier
-Classifier is used to predict the class of any data point.
-It often uses training data to understand the relation between input variables and class
-Classifiers are special hypothesis that are used yo assign class labels too any particular data points

#convert a string to lowercase
-string.lower() e.g:
  variable = "AWESOME"
  print(variable.lower()) #prints out "awesome"

#List of all the keys in a dictionary
- use function dict.keys() # this prints out every key in the dictionary

#Capitalize first letter of a string
-Use function capitalize() e.g:
 n = 'awesome'
 print(n.capitalize())

#Insert an element at a given index
-use function insert()
-Can be used to insert an element at any index of choice e.g:

list1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

list1.insert(6, 10) #insert 10 at 6th index

print(list1)

del list1 # 'del' is used to delete the list in this case

#Remove duplicate elements from a list
-First convert into a set using set() function and then use the list() function to convert it back
PS - A set is a collection of unique elements so there is no duplicate element e.g:



#Recursion
- recursion is a function calling itself one or more times in it body
- a recursion has to be terminated
- there would be a problem of an infinite loop if recursion is not terminated

#List comprehension
- Used for transforming one list to another list
- Elements can be conditionally included in the new list and each element can be transformed as needed e.g:
    my_list = ["x", "y", "z", "z", "y"]
    my_list = list(dict.fromkeys(my_list))
    print(my_list)

#Use of bytes() function
- Used for returning a simple bytes object
- Used to convert objects into byte objects, or create empty byte object of the specified size.

#Types of operators
-Logical e.g: and, or , not
-Arithmetic e.g: +, -, *,/, %
-Relational e.g: <,>, <=, >=, ==,!=
-Assignment e.g: =, +=, -=, *=, %=
-Others e.g: Membership, Identity and Bitwise Operators

#"With" Statement
- "with" statement is used for exception handling
- A file can be opened and closed while executing a block of code, containing "with" statement without using close() function

#map() function
-map() function is used for applying a function on all elements of a specified iterable
-consists of two parameters, function and iterable e.g:
     def add_func(n):
        return n * 3

    num = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    result = map(add_func, num)

    print(list(result))

#__init__ meaning
- reserved method
- constructor of the world of oop
- When an object is created from a class, the __init__ methodology is called to access the attributes of the class

#Tools for static analysis
-Static analysis is how to find bugs in python
- Two tools: pychecker and pylint

#Difference between tuple and dictionary
- Dictionary is mutable and tuple is immutable
- This means the contents of a dictionary can be changed but that's not possible with a tuple

#What is pass in python
- Pass is a statement that does nothing when executed
- It is a null statement
- It is not skipped by the interpreter but the statement results in no operation
- Used when you don't want any command to execute but a statement is required

#How to copy an object
- Not all objects can be copied
- Use the "=" to copy an object to a variable
- Example var = copy.copy(obj)

#How to convert number to a string
- Use str()
- n = 10
new_n = str(n)
print(type(new_n))


#Modules and packages?
- Modules are the means to structure a program
- Each python program file is a module
- the folder of a program is a package of modules
- Package can only have modules or subfolders

#Difference between Numpy and Scipy
- Numpy means Numerical python and Scipy means Scientific python
- Numpy is basic library for defining arrays and simple mathematical problems
- Scipy is used for complex problems like numerical integration, optimization, Machine Learning(ML) etc

#len() function
- len() used to find length of anything you can count e.g a string,array etc
- sentence = 'This is a sentence'
    print(len(sentence))

#Encapsulation
-Encapsulation means binding the code and data together
-Important foundation concept of oop
- E.g a class in python

#type() function
-

split() function
- slip() is used to split a string into shorter string by using defined separators
- letters = ("A,B,C,D,E,F")
    new_letters = letters.split(",")
    print(new_letters)
    print(type(new_letters))
    print(len(new_letters))

#docstring
-

#Lambda() function
- Lambda() functions serve as nameless functions that are needed for short periods of time
- PS - column(:) means "such that"
- triple = lambda x: x * 3

    print(triple(14))

#factorial of a number by using recursion
- Recursion is a concept where the function calls itself multiple times till a certain condition is met
- The condition is important to prevent infinite loops
- def factorial(a):
    if a == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (a * factorial(a - 1))

input_number = 5
print("The factorial of", input_number, "is", factorial(input_number))

#Denote working of bool() with examples
- bool() returns true or false
- it cannot output anything else
-   print(bool(a))
    print(bool(b))
    print(bool(c))
    print(bool(sample_list)

#How to create a new column in pandas using values from other columns.
- We can perform column based mathematical operations on a pandas dataframe
- Pandas columns containing numeric values can be operated upon by operators
- import pandas as pd
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = [2, 3, 5]

    d = {"col1":a, "col2": b}
    df = pd.DataFrame(d)

    df["sum"] = df["col1"] + df["col2"]
    df["difference"] = df["col1"] - df["col2"]

#Different functions that can be used by groupby in pandas
- groupby() function in pandas can be used with multiple aggregate functions
- E.g : sum(),mean(),count(),std()
- Data is divided into groups based on categories and then data in these individual groups can be aggregated by using functions

#How to select columns in pandas and add them to a new dataFrame? What if there are 2 columns with same name?
- if df.Dataframe is pandas, df.columns gives the list of all columns
- We can then form new columns by selecting particular columns
- If there are two columns with same name then both columns get copied to new DataFrame

#How to delete a column or group of columns in pandas?
- drop() function can be used to delete columns from a Dataframe
- d = {"col1":[1, 2, 3], "col2": ["A", "B", "C"]}

    df = pd.DataFrame(d)

    df = df.drop(['col1'], axis = 1)

    df

 #drop specific row in a DataFrame
 - dropna() function
 - d = {"col1":[1, 2, 3], "col2": ["A", "B", "C"]}

    df = pd.DataFrame(d)

    print(df)

    df.dropna(inplace = True)
    df = df[df.col1 != 1]

#What is vstack() in Numpy? Give example
- vstack() functions is used to align rows vertically. All rows must have same number of elements
import numpy as np

n1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
n2 = np.array([50, 60, 70, 80, 90])

#How python code is interpreted:
- python program is converted into intermediate language
- Then it is converted into machine language
- Debugging can be dine modularly and on per-line basis

#How to remove spaces from a string
- Either use strip() function or replace() function
- strip() is used to remove the leading and trailing white spaces while replace() is used to remove all white spaces in/
    a string

random_string = "Mind fulness"
print(random_string.replace(" ", ""))

#File processing modes supported by python
There are 4 file processing modes in python:
- read-only(r)
- write-only(w)
- read-write(rw)
- append(a)

Note : Binary flags - ("r", "w", "rw", "a")

#pickling and unpickling
- Pickling is process of converting a python object hierachy into a byte stream for storing it into a database.
- Pickling is also known as serialization
- Unpickling is reverse of pickling
- the byte stream is converted back into object hierachy

#How memory is managed in python
- Memory management in python has a private heap containing all objects and data structure
- The heap is managed by the interpreter and the programmer does not have acess to it all
- The python memory manager does all the memory allocation
- Moreover there is an inbuilt garbage collector that recycles and frees memory for the heap

#What is unittest in python (Note: "unittest" is NOT "unit test")
- unittest is a unit testing framework in python
- it supports sharing setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, test automation,
    and independence of the tests from the reporting framework

#How to delete a file in python
There are two function:
- os.remove(filename) or os.unlink(filename)

#How to create an empty class
- We can use the pass command after the definition of a class object
- A pass is a statement in oython that does nothing

#Python Decorators
- Decorators are functions that take other functions as arguments to modify
    its behaviour without changing the function itself
- They are useful when we want to dynamically increase the functionality
    of a function without changing it.

#Note: All functions return  a value, if you don't specify the value then they return "None".

#Functions with variable Argument list (*args)

# def main():
#     kitten('meow', 'grrrrr', 'purrrrrr')
    # x = ('meow', 'grrrrr', 'purrrrrr')
    # kitten(*x) It can also be used this way

# def kitten(*args):

#Generators

A generator is a special class of function that serves as an iterator. Instead of returning a single value it returns /
/ a stream of values

# def main():
#     for i in inclusive_range(3, 25, 2):
#         print (i, end = ' ')
#     print()
#
# def inclusive_range(*args):
#     numargs = len(args)
#     start = 0
#     step = 1
#
#     #initialize parameters
#     if numargs < 1:
#         raise TypeError(f'expected: at least 1 argument, got {numargs}')
#     elif numargs == 1:
#         stop = args[0]
#     elif numargs == 2:
#         (start, stop) = args
#     elif numargs == 3:
#         (start, stop, step) = args
#     else: raise TypeError(f'expected: at most 3 arguments, got {numargs}')
#
#     #generator
#     i = start
#     while i <= stop:
#         yield i
#         i += step

#if __name__ == '__main__': main()


#Decorators

A decorator function is a function that returns a wrapper function.



#Sets:
- A set is like a list that does not allow duplicate elements
def main():
#     a = set("We're gonna need a bigger boat.")
#     b = set("Sorry Dave, can't do that.")
#     print_set(sorted(a))
#     print_set(sorted(b))
#
# def print_set(o):
#     print('{', end = '')
#     for x in o: print(x, end ='')
#     print('}')
#
# if __name__ == '__main__': main()


#List Comprehension
- Is a list created based on another list  orr iterator

def main():
    seq = range(1, 11)
    print_list(seq)

def print_list(o):
    for x in o: print(x, end=' ')
    print()

if __name__ == '__main__': main()

#Write data to a file
 with open("my_file_text", "w") as f:
    f.write("sample content 1")

#To append written data in a file
with open("my_file_text", "a") as f:
   f.write(", appended content")

#Initializing class level variables using constructors
import ingest
import persist

class Test:
    def __init__(self, fileType):
        print("i'm within the constructor")
        self.file_type = fileType
    def my_function(self):
         print('inside my function . Processing ' + self.file_type + " file")
         reader = ingest.FileReader(self.file_type)
         writer = persist.PersistData("postgres")
         reader.read_file()
         writer.store_data()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    eg = Test("csv")  #Creating an instance of the objects
    eg.my_function()
    # reader = ingest.FileReader()
    # writer = persist.PersistData()
    # reader.read_file()
    # writer.store_data()

Note: Added files "ingest.py" and "persist.py" to project to better explain how constructors work /
/ and how to work with multiple files

#Logging using basic config:
- Logging.warning is always printed first, to print any other logging /
  / statement it has to defined like so : (logging.basicConfig(level = "DEBUG") where "DEBUG" can be changed to something else

Note: Typically in Production environments you will print only Warning and Error

#Files used - (Main.py, ingest.py,persist.py)

import ingest
import persist
import logging

print("This is a program")

class Test:
    def __init__(self, fileType):
        print("i'm within the constructor")
        self.file_type = fileType
    def my_function(self):
         print('inside my function . Processing ' + self.file_type + " file")
         reader = ingest.FileReader(self.file_type)
         writer = persist.PersistData("postgres")
         reader.read_file()
         writer.store_data()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Entering the main method")
    logging.basicConfig(level = "DEBUG")
    logging.debug("This is a debug message")
    logging.info("This is an info message")
    logging.warning("This is a warning message")
    logging.error("This is an error message")
    print("Hello World")
    eg = Test("csv")  #Creating an instance of the objects
    eg.my_function()

NOTE: Typically in a production environment we will set log level to warning and error but if any issues are encountered
      then we set the log level to debug or info to get more information from the application.
